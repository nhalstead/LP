class.user.php for all classes
Member.php for all design of form.

database is included and needed to create/login users.

when i submit the form, i get these 2 errors tried looking everywhere but could find it.
Notice: Undefined index: fname in C:\xampp\htdocs\LP-master\include\class.user.php on line 231
Notice: Undefined index: lname in C:\xampp\htdocs\LP-master\include\class.user.php on line 232

in database there is 2 tables: users which have the information when one create and login ( fname, lname & email )
& members who have the data for fname, lname, email, address, zip, city, phone etc.

it can add the data to the database except the fname and lname, also i cant get it work to that the form will save the data when the member look at his profile form.
